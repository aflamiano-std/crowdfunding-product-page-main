## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge for this project is to build out the product page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

It focuses on the use of HTML, CSS and JS.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Make a selection of which pledge to make
- Toggle whether or not the product is bookmarked

## My process
1. I started with the main html template with a mobile first approach. The general flow of the elements are not much different from the desktop design making it easy to plot.
2. I included all the modal content at the end and styled it to display: none to focus on styling the main page first. Starting with the page header I decided to leave the navigation part for later and focused on just the design then continued on to each section.
3. Once all the styles for the main page were done, I started to style the modal content.
4. I proceeded to add the active states for the interactive elements on the page.
5. After finishing all the styles, I started to add the necessary JS for opening and closing the modals and other interactions.
6. I then started to work on the page header and finished the project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM naming convention

### Continued development

I started using flex-grid on some parts of this project and it proved to be efficient in what I was trying to accomplish. I plan on using flex-grid more often and pair it with flex-box as needed to make pages more structured and responsive. There are also interactive elements which can be improved by adding JS elements and form validation but I only focused on the design aspect for now and I plan to look into applying them later in the future.
